# Colour Switch


## Details:
This is a clone of the strategy game :video_game: , Colour Switch originally developed by Pheonix Games

Made as a part of project in Advanced Programming course at IIIT-Delhi.

Uses Java and JavaFx.

## Features:
⭐️ Game :video_game: progresses in infite display with increasing difficulty </br>
⭐️ In-Game upgrades available (Clover and Rocket) that boosts score on gameplay </br>
⭐️ Implementation of Bonus Shop feature to buy upgrades and custom balls </br>
⭐️ In game assets: 
  1. Obstacles Available :red_circle:: Cross, Line, Triangle, Circle and Rectangle
  1. Balls Available :softball:: Normal Ball, Ice Ball, Fire ball, Pink Ball, Green-light Ball
  1. How To Play :page_facing_up:: Displays details of Game Play
  1. Rocket and Clover :four_leaf_clover:: Upgrades for score boost 
  1. Save Game and Restart Game options: User can save multiple game states, and reload them. 
  1. Background Music :speaker: for cooler interactions 

## Implementation:
1. The implementation of the user interface was achieved using FXML and CSS for further UI improvements. 
2. The implementation of the project follows a strict object-oriented paradigm in addition to generic programming with well-defined classes for each component of the gameplay.
3. The gameplay additionally uses the functionality of event-driven programming using JavaFX to create an infinite gameplay setting, various obstacles and transitions for all moving objects. 
4. It also utilizes threads and timers for parallel execution of multiple features such as moving the ball, incrementing the high and checking collisions with other game components. 
5. It takes into account various design patterns of software development.
Additionally, serialization has been implemented to store the progress during a particular setting of the game.  

## Design Patterns:
1. Singleton
2. Iterator
3. Facade

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the Java-Fx SDK
3. Run the entire project in a Java Environment and you are good to go!
